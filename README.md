**Track your time effortlessly.**

tempo-timer is a simple desktop app designed for logging time on Jira issues directly into Tempo Timesheets. It’s perfect for users who prefer real-time tracking (like me!) and find existing web UI and/or browser extension very slow or clunky (also, like me!). Currently, tracking is limited to "today"—for other dates, use the Tempo web interface.

The app is tested on macOS. It supports Jira Cloud only.

## Features
- ⏱ **Track time** directly in Tempo Timesheets
- ✍ **Edit worklogs** before submitting (time & description)
- 🔍 **Search Jira issues** quickly
- ⭐ **Save favorite issues** for fast access
- 🎛 **Manage multiple timers** simultaneously
- 🌙 **Dark mode support**
