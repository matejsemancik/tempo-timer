# tempo-timer

Minimalistic desktop client for Tempo Timesheets written in Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform.

This project aims to provide a simple interface for tracking time spent on Jira issues into Tempo without burden of interacting with Jira (slow), or Tempo browser extension (clumsy). It is intended mainly for users who like to track time in real-time. Tracking for dates other than "today" is not yet supported.
